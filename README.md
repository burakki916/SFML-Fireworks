# SFML-Fireworks
firework looking things coded in c++/sfml

[video showing some of the programs capabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHdo6aXI7SE)

though right now to change any of the fireworks you gotta recompile it lol.
maybe later ill make it so where it takes inputs from like a text document or something. that would probably make it like a lot better/ usable
